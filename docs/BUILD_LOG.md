## Questions for Jake

*(none blocking — FYI items below)*

- **Credentials in the build environment**: this remote session has no `.env.local`; `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `FANTASYPROS_API_KEY`, `WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `COMMISSIONER_PASSWORD`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `CRON_SECRET`, and BYOK keys are only in Vercel. Build/tests that need them run against preview deployments (M3 smoke tests, M4 mock draft, M7 alarm email). If you want them runnable locally in this session, add them to the session environment; otherwise no action needed until M3.
- **FantasyPros free-tier measurement** (§5.7/5.8 verify) requires the key — will run the counted probe suite at M4 and record in VERIFIED.md.

## 2026-08-28 — Environment limitation: direct database access from the build sandbox

The remote build container reaches the outside world only through an HTTPS egress proxy. Two consequences, neither of which affects production:

- **Postgres over TCP (port 5432) is blocked**, so `postgres-js` / `node-postgres` cannot connect to Neon from here.
- **Neon's SQL-over-HTTP host** (`api.c-11.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech`) is not in the proxy allowlist, so the Neon HTTP driver returns 403 from here. (The Neon MCP connector reaches the same database by a different path and works fine, which is how infrastructure was inspected.)

Decisions:
- `packages/engine/scripts/migrate.ts` uses Neon's HTTP driver and is wired into `apps/web`'s `build` script, so **every Vercel deploy applies migrations before `next build`**. That is the right production path regardless of the sandbox: preview deploys migrate the branch database, production migrates `main`.
- Engine and data tests run against **PGlite** (in-memory Postgres) with the real migration files, so schema and rules are fully covered without a network database.
- If Jake wants live database work from a future Claude session, adding `api.*.neon.tech` to the session's egress allowlist is all that is needed.

## 2026-08-28 — Session start: recon, docs, plan

- Read SPEC.md v1.8 in full (twice). Kit files were not yet in the repo (starter Next app only); copied `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/fantasypros_v2_public.yaml`, standing-rules `CLAUDE.md` (keeping the repo's `AGENTS.md` Next 16 warning via `@AGENTS.md`), wrote `.env.example`, monorepo `.gitignore`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/VERIFIED.md`, this log.
- **Environment**: remote build container. Node v22 local (Vercel project is 24.x — CI will use 24; engines field set accordingly). pnpm 10.33. Git branch for all work in this session: `claude/agent-fantasy-football-fe0inf` (remote session's designated branch; milestone PRs open from it).
- **Network**: initially `api.sleeper.app`, `api.sleeper.com`, `ai-gateway.vercel.sh` were blocked by the session egress policy; Jake widened access mid-session — all reachable now. FantasyPros reachable (403 without key, as expected).
- **Infrastructure confirmed live** (Appendix G): Vercel team `jake-moses-personal` (Pro), project `agent-fantasy-football-league` (`prj_k6qNYEikbH78EUElfZrdFSex8rfm`, Node 24.x, starter deployed READY on production). Neon project `small-unit-52703563` (Postgres 18, aws-us-east-1, free plan 512MB/branch). Neon + Vercel are also operable from this session through their MCP connectors (SQL, branches, deploy inspection) — used for migrations and mock-draft branch work.
- **Verified** (details in VERIFIED.md): all 12 gateway model IDs resolve; two corrected (`google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `spacexai/grok-4.6` — xAI now under `spacexai/`). Catalog prices captured for `model_prices` seed.
- **Choices**:
  - Unit tests run against **PGlite** (in-memory Postgres) so `packages/engine` is fully testable with no server and no network; the same Drizzle schema runs on Neon PG 18 in deploys. Live-API tests are tagged and skipped when the key/fixture is absent (CLAUDE.md convention).
  - The starter app is Next 16.2.4 (React 19.2, Tailwind 4) — per `AGENTS.md`, Next 16 has breaking changes; I read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any `apps/web` code (M3+/M5).
